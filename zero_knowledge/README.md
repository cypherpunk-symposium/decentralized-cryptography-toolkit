## zero-knowledge 

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

##### proofs

* **zero-knowledge proofs** represent **programs as circuits**, where a **prover** generates a proof from public and private inputs, and a **verifier** computes the output if the statement is correct (without any information regarding the private input).
* three fundamental characteristics define a zkp:
  * completeness (if a statement is true, then an honest verifier can be convinced by an honest prover that they possess knowledge about the correct input).
  * soundness (if a statement is false, then no dishonest prover can unilaterally convince an honest verifier that they have knowledge about the correct input).
  * zero-knowledge (if the state is true, then the verifier learns nothing more from the prover other than that).
* zk proofs use cases:
  * **private transactions**: blockchains such as zcash, with privacy-preserving txs.
  * **verifiable computations**: decentralized oracle networks, providing smart contracts with access to off-chain data.
  * **highly-scalable and secure l2s**: verifiable computations through methods such as zk-rollups, validiums, and volition by they use l1s as a settlement layer.
  * **decentralized identity and authentication**: zkps can underpin identity management systems to enable users to validate their identity.

##### zk-rollups

<br>

* **zk-rollups** write transactions to ethereum as calldata, using compression techniques to reduce transaction data. while calldata is not stored as part of the evm's state, it persists on-chain as part of the chain's history logs.
* the zk-rollup's state, which includes l2 accounts and balances, is represented as a merkle tree.
* users in the zk-rollup sign transactions and submit them to l2 operators for processing and inclusion in the next batch. in some cases, the operator is a centralized entity (the sequencer), that executes transactions, aggregates them into batches, and submits to L1.
* the rollup contract won't automatically accept the proposed state commitment until the operator proves the new merkle root resulted from correct updates to the rollupâ€™s state (this comes from validity proofs).
* goals:
 * lower gas fees (by tx baches and submitting minimal on-chain data)
 * higher throughput (fast tx speeds, reduced confirmation times, up to 100x)
 * fastter confirmation time (no need to wait for block confirmations on the base layer, finality on l2)
 * privacy (no info about the tx is leaked, concealing tx amounts and recipients)
 * proof generation costs can be high (reducing proof generation costs involves using more efficient proof systems or circuit designs or incentivizing provers).
 * high circuit complexity can affect zk-rollups' scalability and usability
 * compatibility issues (not fully compatible with existing smart contracts or tools)
